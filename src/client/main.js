/* 
This file is used to import the non-react things alongside React, apparently.
It is the entry point for both config files. 

Perhaps then,
we could have 2 entry points.

One would be this main.js file.
It would contain desktop stuff:
-> desktop components setup - regular sidebar
->desktop css


and then another would be mobile.js
it would contain mobile stuff:
-> mobile components setup - collapsible sidebar, or top
different navigation setup
-> mobile css

I could then use these files to reference the components for each setup.
